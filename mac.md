## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? - Set of commands to be used in your terminal.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? - Git is a set of commands to be used in your terminal and Github is where we hold repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch? - To have a comparison of work you start with and what you're actively editing. The goal is to recombine everything.
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? - To inform others of changes you've made/pushed to a branch inside a repository.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. - Git Checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? - Git Fetch: Fetches without merging/download content from a remote repository, Git Merge: Intergrating code into a single branch, Git Pull: Fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and updates the local repository to match that content.
 
7. What is a merge conflict? - The result of merging branches with different commits and commands.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? - First you assess differences in code and correct mistakes, then you use git add a to stage the new merged content then finally you create a new commit with git commit.
